# Aerosys HVAC — Project Performance, Cost Control & Profitability (prototype)

A functional web prototype of Aerosys HVAC's internal system. It is built to answer one question for management:

> **Are we executing our projects efficiently, and are we actually making money on them?**

It links four layers so that each one feeds the next:

```
WORK ORDER → ANNEXURE / BOQ → EXECUTED QUANTITY → EXECUTED VALUE → PROGRESS → EARNED VALUE
DAILY WORK LOGS → CONSUMED MAN-DAYS / IDLE DAYS → WAGES → RUNNING PPI
WAGES + EXPENSES + OVERHEAD + INSTRUMENT + MANAGEMENT → COST TO DATE → PROJECTED FINAL COST → PROJECTED PROFIT
```

It runs entirely in the browser. Realistic sample data is seeded on first load and persisted to
`localStorage`, so changes survive a refresh. No backend is required.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # type-check + production build into dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build
```

## Deploying to Vercel

The repo is ready for Vercel with no extra configuration (`vercel.json` is included):

1. In Vercel, **Add New → Project** and import this GitHub repository.
2. Vercel detects **Vite** automatically. The build command is `npm run build` and the output directory is `dist`.
   Both are also pinned in `vercel.json`.
3. Click **Deploy**.

Alternatively, from the command line: `npm i -g vercel && vercel` (preview) or `vercel --prod`.

Notes:
- `vercel.json` rewrites every route to `index.html`, so deep links such as `/projects/prj_1` work when
  the page is refreshed or opened directly.
- Hashed files in `/assets` are served with long-lived cache headers.
- Node 20.19+ is required (declared in `package.json` → `engines`). Vercel's default Node 22 works.
- No environment variables are needed. `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is only relevant once a real backend is connected.
- Each visitor's demo data lives in their own browser's localStorage, so data is not shared between users
  or devices on the deployed site.

To restore the original sample data, go to **Settings → Reset demo data**.

## Demo walkthrough (about 10 minutes)

1. **Sign in as Management.** The dashboard shows contract value, earned value, actual cost, projected
   final cost and projected profit. Click **Projected profit** to see the portfolio P&L. **Attention required**
   lists observations generated from the data, such as *"Apex Pharma … consumed 50% of allotted man-days but
   is only 36% complete"*. The **Project financial health** table colour-codes every project; the
   *At risk / Over budget / Below baseline* cards filter it.
2. **Open *Phoenix Mall HVAC Retrofit*** (healthy). The Overview shows 12 health-coded KPIs. Click **PPI** or
   **Running PPI** to see the equation behind each number. Click **Financial health** for the full P&L:
   contract value → cost heads → cost to date → earned value → projected remaining cost → projected profit.
3. **Annexure / BOQ tab.** On *Installation of Air Handling Unit*, choose **Update execution** and record
   3 Nos. Return to Overview: progress, earned value and Running PPI have all moved.
4. **New daily log.** The team is pre-filled from assignments. Mark one person **Idle** with the reason
   *Site not ready*, add a work line against a BOQ item, and add a small expense. The preview shows the
   man-days, idle days and work value the log will add. Save it, and consumed man-days, idle days, wages and
   progress update.
5. **Expenses tab → Approve** the expense you just added. Consumed expenses, cost to date and projected
   profit update.
6. **Performance tab** shows PPI vs Running PPI, plan vs actual (progress, man-days, expenses, cost),
   cumulative earned value vs cost, man-day burn, and idle days by reason.
7. **Employees → edit Vikram Patil → change Daily Cost.** Wages on every project he worked on are
   re-priced immediately.
8. **Compare the other projects:** *Orchid IT Park* (efficient: high progress, low man-days),
   *GreenTech* (expenses running well ahead of progress), *Sunrise Tower* (high idle time),
   *Apex Pharma* (low Running PPI), *Metro Hospital* (low projected margin), and *Blue Ridge* / *Horizon* (completed).
9. **Switch roles** with the Demo role selector. A Site Engineer sees execution metrics but no wages,
   costs or profit. A Project Manager only sees and logs their own projects.

## Roles

| Role | Can see / do |
| --- | --- |
| Management | Everything: all projects, costs, profit, daily cost rates, reports, approvals, BOQ, daily logs, settings |
| Project Manager | Own projects: daily logs, BOQ/execution, engineer assignment, expense approval, instruments, costs |
| Site Engineer | Assigned projects' execution metrics (progress, man-days, idle, PPI) but no wages, costs or profit; own expenses & instruments |
| Accounts | All projects' costs and profitability, all expenses (view), employees and daily cost rates, financial reports |

Permissions live in `src/auth/permissions.ts`. The UI reads capability flags such as `can("expense.approve")`,
and project rows are scoped per user by `scopeProjects()`.

## Business rules & assumptions

Every formula lives in **one place**: `src/domain/assumptions.ts`. Rules that Aerosys has not yet
confirmed are marked `DEMO ASSUMPTION` there, and the adjustable ones can be changed in **Settings**
without code. Components never re-implement formulas. They read results from `src/domain/performance.ts`
and explanations from `src/domain/explain.ts`, so the calculation drawers can never disagree with the KPIs.

| Metric | Formula | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PPI | Work Order Value ÷ Allotted Man-Days | Working hypothesis |
| Progress | Σ(executed qty × rate) ÷ Σ(BOQ contract amount) — value-weighted | Demo model |
| Earned value | Work Order Value × Progress | |
| Running PPI | Earned Value ÷ Consumed Man-Days | Demo assumption |
| Consumed man-days | On-site, off-site and idle entries = 1 MD each; weekly off, holiday and leave = 0 | |
| Idle days | Σ idle person-days + partial idle hours ÷ *working hours per man-day* (Settings) | |
| Wages | Consumed MD × employee **Daily Cost** (current rate; not derived from salary or CTC) | Demo assumption |
| Expenses | Approved expenses only (pending ones are shown separately) | |
| Overhead | *x*% of wages (Settings, default 20%) | Demo assumption |
| Instrument charges | Purchase value × monthly rate × months deployed (Settings, default 3%) | Demo assumption |
| Management charges | *x*% of earned value (Settings, default 3%) | Demo assumption |
| Projected final cost | *Performance:* cost to date ÷ progress, or *budget:* cost to date + budget × (1 − progress) (Settings). Uses the budget method below 10% progress. | Estimate |
| Plan to date | Linear between start and expected completion (drives expected progress and planned MD/expenses) | Demo assumption |

**KPI colours** (green = healthy, amber = needs attention, red = concerning, neutral = informational) use
thresholds in `HEALTH_THRESHOLDS` (same file) plus the target margin in Settings. Consumption metrics are
judged against progress. For example, having used 58% of the man-days at 64% progress is healthy.

### Connecting a real backend

Components never touch storage directly. They go through `src/services/*`, whose methods already match REST endpoints:

| Service method | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| `projectService.list / get / create / update / remove` | `GET/POST /api/projects`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/projects/:id` |
| `assignmentService.assign / release` | `POST /api/projects/:id/assignments`, `DELETE /api/assignments/:id` |
| `boqService.createItem / addExecution / closePeriod` | `POST /api/projects/:id/boq-items`, `POST /api/boq-items/:id/executions`, … |
| `dailyLogService.save / remove` | `POST /api/projects/:id/daily-logs`, `PUT/DELETE /api/daily-logs/:id` |
| `expenseService.create / approve / reject` | `POST /api/expenses`, `POST /api/expenses/:id/approve`, `…/reject` |
| `instrumentService.assign / returnInstrument / setStatus` | `POST /api/instruments/:id/assign`, `…/return`, `PATCH …/status` |

To connect a backend, replace each method body with a call through `src/api/http.ts`. For example,
`list: () => http.get<Project[]>("/api/projects")`. Pages, forms and hooks stay as they are.
Business side effects that currently run in the mock services, such as notifications and closing
assignments when a project completes, would move to the server.
